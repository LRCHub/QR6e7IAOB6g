```lrc
[00:28.00] Time stands still
[00:33.50] Creeping up on me
[00:37.00] Something yet forgone
[00:42.95] Carrying these thoughts of mine
[00:48.95] Iridescence fragmented and distant
[00:56.00] But how could I
[01:03.40] Recognize?
[01:11.10] Hide away from my mistakes
[01:14.53] Solace comes in many shapes
[01:18.00] If I tried, will it remain?
[01:24.73] Oh, when I gazed upon the shores that none could know
[01:34.87] The fog was gone, I'm yearning for more though
[01:41.70] Could you tell me when tides came to be so low?
[02:07.30] Carrying these thoughts of mine
[02:13.60] Iridescencе fragmented and distant
[02:21.00] "Whole", gеntle wish that I would beg to calm my soul
[02:31.80] A memory or place to call "Home"
[02:38.12] Reminiscing mornings that would give me hope
[02:45.20] But "home"
[02:52.20] Echoes miles away yet makes me feel alone
[02:59.67] It resonates in ways I've never known
[03:06.55] When the tide draws near, you'll come to call me home
